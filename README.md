# Welcome To The Mouse ODC Repository!

## What is the MouseODC

The mouse ODC is an application to help actively collect meta data from animal studies and experiments through the use of web app forms. It is a rendition of the DNP's OpenDataCapture web application. This current repository contains the code for all forms to be used within the application. 
## Entering the MouseODC

After requesting account to be created with your group admin, you can log in and access the MouseODC  [here](http://mouseodc.douglas.rtss.qc.ca/auth/login). Currently hosted and accessible on the internal douglas network with a public facing application in the works :)
